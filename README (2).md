## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

First completed the html pages before designing with css. Although i made some changes to the html page as i saw fit during the design process

### What I learned

at the last minute, i learnt how to border-radius to specific sides of a shape rather than the entire corners. Still working on mastering the use of drop shadow.

### Continued development

will be working on integrating boostrap css formats in future designs
